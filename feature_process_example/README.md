**Transformation Process**

Linear Layer: Maps input features (B, 1024) to (B, n * e)

Reshape Operation: Restructures to (B, n, e)


**Visual Demonstration**

To facilitate better understanding, let's consider a concrete example with actual dimensions:

Input: Image features of shape (16, 1024)

↓ Linear Transformation

Intermediate: Features of shape (16, 29184) [114 * 256 = 29,184]

↓ Reshape Operation

Output: Final features of shape (16, 114, 256)

**Usage**

```python
python img_transformation_demo.py
```
